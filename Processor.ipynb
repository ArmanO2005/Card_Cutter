Drought caused more deaths during the last century than any other natural disaster.” That same year, the US drought led the Department of Agriculture to issue its most extensive disaster declaration ever, one that included almost one-third of the counties in the United States, covering 26 states.20 Storms The expected increase in frequency and severity of the two types of storms that are most destructive of agriculture – hurricanes and extreme rain with flooding – will have a major impact on food production, if the past is any guide.\n",

      "“Aquifer depletion now,” said Lester Brown in his 2013 article on peak water, “threatens harvest in China, India, and the United States,” which “together supply half of the world’s grain harvest.” With regard to China, “the water table under the North China Plain, an area that produces over half of the country’s wheat and a third of its corn, is falling fast.” With regard to India, “The country’s farmers have drilled 21 million irrigation wells, with the result that water tables are falling in almost every state.”31 The first country “to publicly reveal how aquifer depletion will shrink its grain harvest,” Brown added, was Saudi Arabia: In the 1970s, the Saudis “developed a heavily subsidized irrigated agriculture based on pumping water from a fossil aquifer over a half-mile below the surface. In early 2008, with the aquifer largely depleted, the Saudis announced that they will phase out wheat production by 2016.” As a result, Saudi Arabia will start “importing roughly 14 million metric tons of wheat, rice, corn, and barley.”32 Given Saudi Arabia’s relatively small population, this development will not cause a shock too large for world markets to absorb.\n",
